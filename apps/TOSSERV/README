0. Preamble
***********
The TOSServ application comes with three main components. First is 
the Finger2 binary which is used inside TOSSIM as an example 
application to interact with using the Policy IDE client, the second 
component. The third component is TOSServ's serverside component,
which acts as an intermediary between the Policy IDE client, and Finger2.

The Finger2 source is contained within the /src/ folder. TOSServ's
client and server components are contained within the /TOSSERV/ folder.

1. Installation Instructions and Build Environment Prerequisites
****************************************************************
In order to build the Finger2 binary, you require the following:

-Linux with gcc and build-essential 3.5 is required. Development and
testing was performed on the XUbunTOS image provided on the tinyOS
development wiki.

-TinyOS Development Kit (tinyOS version 2.1.2 or later) 
must be installed and working.

-All TinyOS Development Kit environment variables must be set up correctly.

-Python 2.7 or later must be installed.

Installation:
-Copy the contents of the archive into the a folder on your local filesystem.
-In order to run the server remotely, copy the contents of the same folder on
the remote client PC.
-Ensure that the PYTHONPATH environment variable has the folders added.

This package has been provided as an Eclipse project. In order to use this
system with Eclipse, simply Import the project into Eclipse from the local
filesystem.


2. Supported Wireless Sensor Platforms
**************************************
micaz sim
-Only the micaz platform is supported, as this is the only platform
which is currently supported for simulation in TOSSIM. The provided
Finger2 binary can be compiled and executed on other platforms,
but this is not supported.

3. Testing Instructions
***********************
Provided all prerequisites are met, you should be able to run the python
files provided.

Initiate the TOSServ server by executing TOSServ.py:
	python TOSServ.py
	
TOSServ automatically binds the xml-rpc protocol to port 8000.

You may connect to it from a remote machine, or on the local host using
the client:
	python PIDEClient.py
