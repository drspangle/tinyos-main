1. Installation Instructions and Build Environment Prerequisites
****************************************************************
In order to build the Finger2IPv6 binary, you require the following:

-Linux with gcc and build-essential 4.6.3 is required. Development and
testing was performed on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS as it has long term support.
Other versions of Linux that come with gcc 4.6.3 should also work.

-Ensure your current user has access to the USB interface. In Ubuntu,
the following command will add a user to the correct group:
	sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>
After entering the command, log out and then log back in for the changes
to take effect. In other operating systems, a different group 
may be required.

-NetCat6 (nc6) must be installed for testing.

-The toolchain must be installed from the 'tinyprod' repository. 
The msp430-46 version is required. See http://tinyprod.net/debian-dev/ 
for details.

-TinyOS Development Kit (tinyOS version 2.1.2 or later) 
must be installed and working.

-All TinyOS Development Kit environment variables must be set up correctly.

-Be sure to check section 2 of this README to ensure that your wireless sensor 
platform is supported by Finger2IPv6. If your platform is not listed, it is 
NOT currently supported and it will not compile or load.

-A 6LoWPAN/IPv6 Edge Router must be installed on your network in order to pass
packets between the 6LoWPAN and IPv6 interfaces on your network.
For more information, see the PppRouter application documentation.

Installation:
-Copy the application into the $TOSROOT/apps/finger2ipv6/ folder.

-Open a terminal and navigate to the folder using:
	cd $TOSROOT/apps/finger2ipv6/

-Compile the application for your desired platform:
	make <platform> blip

-If compilation is successful, continue. If it fails, ensure you meet the
prequisites listed at the beginning of this section, and your platform is
supported.

-Plug your sensor mote in to the USB port. Use the 'motelist' command to
check the handle to the device. If no other devices are connected,
this is commonly /dev/ttyUSB0 .

-Recompile and install the compiled binary, invoking the proper flags 
to install the blip stack, and set the IPv6 address suffix of the device:
	make <platform> blip install.<address> bsl,<device handle>


2. Supported Wireless Sensor Platforms
**************************************
telosb 
-Tested and verified working.

epic 
-Tested, but not all functions supported.
See the blip documentation on the tinyOS Wiki for more information.


3. Testing Instructions
***********************
Provided all prerequisites are met, and the Finger2IPv6 program has been
successfully installed, you should be able to connect directly to the mote
using nc6.

You should have provided an IPv6 address suffix when the mote was
programmed. You will use this to provide the full address of the mote.

Note: the default IPv6 prefix is defined in the MAKEFILE, and is fec0::

Assuming your edge router is up and running, connect to the device using
its IPv6 address, on port 2000:
	nc6 -u fec0::<suffix> 2000

If the connection was successful, type 'help' (without quotes) and press
enter. You should see the help menu for the device, will all commands listed.

The 'f2help' command will give specific help for Finger2IPv6 commands, and the
policy programming interface provided.
